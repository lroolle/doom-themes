[design] Theme porting: Map Emacs color vars to VS Code token scopes systematically
[best-practice] Dark theme: Keywords & operators both use blue (#51afef) in Emacs
[best-practice] Light theme: Keywords use red (#e45649), operators use blue (#4078f2)
[gotcha] HTML tags vs tag names: Tags use blue, tag names use red in both themes
[optimization] VS Code themes: Use "type": "dark"/"light" for proper system integration
